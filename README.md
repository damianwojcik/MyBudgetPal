# MyBudgetPal 📈

## What
Web App used to tracking of house budget. Inspired by [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/). Created to monitor daily incomes and expenses. Improving habit of saving and wise spending of money.

## Why
Common budget apps are too complicated and hard to use. Tracking of daily budget in Excel sheets is slow and not readable on mobile devices.

## How
Created concept prototypes in `Figma` - [Link](https://www.figma.com/file/CnrZwXgLX8mpFVlWtyAp319S/MyBudgetPal?node-id=0%3A1)
Used `React` to create web app.
`Firebase` as backend (for now).
