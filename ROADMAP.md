-   onRemoveEntry removes entry from UI too!

-   auth as homepage. others protected
-   prop-types

-   routes(pages) as containers
-   add /entry route with id param
-   add 'add' route (npm i react-router-dom)
-   add 404 redirect
-   code spliting async rendering - react SUSPENSE
-   test performance by:
    componentDidUpdate () {
    console.log('[ComponentName]componentDidUpdate')
    }
- authRedirect as HOC ?
- connect filling EntryAdd form to redux? so data is saved when switch to dashboard and back?
- login page autocomplete
